<h1>The Problem</h1>
<p>Data URIs are a powerful way to embed entire resources (images, HTML, etc) in the link itself. For example, the link</p>
<code>data:text/html,&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code>
<p>displays an HTML page. Note that the HTML does not come from some external server, but from the link itself. Thus, you don't need a host to serve up HTML if you do it like this.</p>
<p>However, such links are long and clunky. If one could use a URL shortener, things would be great!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, URL shorteners do not accept Data URIs for security reasons.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>URI Redirect redirects requests from this webpage to any other page specified as a GET parameter.</p>
<p>This tool works around the limitation of URL shorteners not accepting data URIs. For example, this will shorten properly, since this looks like a normal webpage to the shortener.</p>
<code>https://sjhuang26.github.io/uri-redirect/r.html?uri=[[DATA URI]]</code>
<p>However, the shortened link will in turn redirect to the data URI specified.</p>
<p>Note: Data URIs (and thus the HTML) feature are not well supported in Internet Explorer.</p>
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<h2>Redirect to URI</h2>
<code>https://sjhuang26.github.io/uri-redirect/r.html?uri=[[URI]]</code>
<h2>Redirect to HTML</h2>
<p>This is just for convenience. It is just a URI redirect for <code>data:text/html,[[HTML]]</code>.</p>
<code>https://sjhuang26.github.io/uri-redirect/r.html?html=[[HTML]]</code>
